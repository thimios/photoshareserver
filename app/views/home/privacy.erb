  <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
  Welcome to So Berlin! This policy outlines how we use the data we collect and what you can do to

  influence it. Our app depends on people sharing their favorite locations and we want to make sure all

  our users feel comfortable and save in doing so. If you have further comments or concerns, please do

  not hesitate to contact us under <a href="mailto:info@soberlin.org">info(at)soberlin.org</a>.  <br/>

  There are two ways in which we collect information:<br/>

  <b>1. Personal data when you sign up for the app</b>

  When you sign up for or use our products, you voluntarily give us certain information such as your

  email address, age, sex, profile photo, locations, photos, comments, votes (or likes) and any other

  information you provide us. If you're using So Berlin on your mobile device, you are recommended to

  provide us with location data for optimal functionalities. Note that we do not require you to give us your

  name at any point throughout the app.<br/>

  You also may give us permission to access your information in other services. For example, you may

  link your Facebook or other accounts to So Berlin, which allows us to obtain information from those

  accounts (e.g., your friends or contacts). The information we obtain from those services often depends

  on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check what those are.<br/>

  <b>2. Technical information when you use our app</b>

  Whenever you use a website, mobile application, or other Internet service, there's certain information

  that almost always gets created and recorded in an automated way. The same is true when you use

  our products, and here are some of the types of information we collect in this way.   <br/>

  For instance, when you use So Berlin, our servers automatically record information about your

  interaction with our products ("log data"), including information that your browser sends whenever

  you visit a website or your mobile app sends when you use it to access So Berlin. This log data may

  include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web page you were visiting before you

  came to So Berlin, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, and how you used So

  Berlin.<br/>

  In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you're using So Berlin on,

  including what type of device it is, what operating system you're using, device settings, unique device

  identifiers as well as crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends

  on what type of device you're using and its settings. For example, different types of information are

  available depending on whether you're using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To

  learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please also check the policies

  of your device manufacturer or software provider.<br/>

  We use the information we collect to provide our products to you and make them better, develop

  new products, and protect So Berlin and our users. We may use the content you voluntarily provided

  (including photos and locational data thereof) within or outside the So Berlin app, to be able to provide

  users and other customers of So Berlin a guide to hot spots around the world. We will not share your

  email with outside parties under any circumstances.   <br/>

  We also use the information we collect to: Send you So Berlin updates, So Berlin newsletters, So

  Berlin marketing materials and other information that may be of interest to you.

  The information we collect may be "personally identifiable" (meaning it can be used to specifically

  identify you as a unique person) or "non-personally identifiable" (meaning it can't be used to

  specifically identify you). We use both types of information, and combinations of both types, as

  described above.                                           <br/>

  So Berlin is a tool people use to get inspired and find Berlin moments in their neighborhood and

  around the world as well as inspire others by posting locations of their own. When you create a

  post, vote or comment, anyone can view them. Also, whom you follow and who is following you,

  your pictures taken with the So Berlin app is publicly available. You also provide us with profile page

  information that anyone can view. The other limited instances where we may share your personal

  information include:
  <ul>
    <li>
      When we have your consent. This includes sharing information with other services (like

      Facebook or Twitter) when you’ve chosen to link to your So Berlin account to those services. For

      example, you can choose to publish your pins to Facebook or Twitter.

    </li>
    <li>
      We may employ third party companies or individuals to process personal information on our

      behalf based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy. For example, we may

      share data with a security consultant to help us get better at identifying spam or with our accountants

      to make sure we’re keeping the books right. If we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to

      comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public,

      any person, or So Berlin; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical

      issues.

    </li>
    <li>
      We may engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar

      transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Policy.

      We may change this policy from time to time, and if we do we’ll post any changes on this page. If

      you continue to use So Berlin after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised policy. If the

      changes are significant, we may provide more prominent notice or obtain your consent as required by

      law.

    </li>
  </ul>
